Q. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters

You are given a string ‘S’, you need to find the length of the longest 
substring that contains at most two distinct characters.

Note:

A string ‘B’ is a substring of a string ‘A’ if ‘B’ that can be obtained 
by deletion of, several characters(possibly none) from the start of ‘A’ 
and several characters(possibly none) from the end of ‘A’. 

Follow up :
Can you try to solve this problem in O(N) time and O(1) space.
Example :
If ‘S’ = “ninninja”

Then, “ninnin” is the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters. We will print the length of this substring which is equal to 6.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )

Constraints :
1 ≤ T ≤ 10      
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000
Where 'S' contains lowercase English alphabets


Sample Input 1 :
2
ninninja
aaa
Sample Output 1 :
6
3

Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
For test case 1 :
We will print 6 because:
“ninnin” is the longest substring containing at most two distinct characters.

For test case 2 : 
We will print 3 because:
The given string “aaa” itself contains a single character, therefore the longest substring will itself be “aaa”.
